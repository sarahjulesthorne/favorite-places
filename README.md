# Favorite Places  
### Description  
The project makes an XHR request, passes an array from the data parsed from that request into a string builder function, and prints the string built using values from that array to the page.  
Styling of card image heights and background colors is done in CSS.  
HTML sets divs for the page and cards, and a title for the page.
